# Minecraft server daemon

Minecraftd is a daemon hosting a JVM for [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net/) servers, with a D-Bus
interface for IPC. This allows Minecraft servers to be managed as proper UNIX
services, without resorting to [GNU Screen](http://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) and a host of shell scripts.
